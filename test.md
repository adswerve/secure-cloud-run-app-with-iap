Here's a rephrased version of the information you provided, using the same style as the previous README:

## Quick Proxy Solution for Cloud Run

While not as secure or centralized as IAP, a quick alternative is to set up a proxy for your Cloud Run service.

### Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the `proxy_demo` directory.
2. Open the `proxy.sh` file.
3. Execute the commands in `proxy.sh` sequentially.

### Considerations

- **Pros**: 
  - Faster to implement
  - Simpler configuration
- **Cons**:
  - Less secure than IAP
  - Lacks centralized management
  - May not be suitable for production environments

### When to Use

- For rapid prototyping
- In development environments
- When full IAP setup is not immediately feasible

**Note**: For production deployments, it's strongly recommended to use the full IAP solution described in the main setup instructions.
